## First Program:

1. **What is a table in SQL?**
   * In SQL, a table is a structured data container with rows and columns, representing a 2-dimensional structure where each row represents a single record, and each column represents an attribute or field.

2. **Provide a list of the table names mentioned in the program.**
   * The program mentions the following table names: Customers, Categories, Employees, OrderDetails, Orders, Products, Shippers, Suppliers.

3. **Explain the SQL query: `select * from customers;`**
   * This SQL query selects all rows and columns from the "customers" table, returning all the data in the table.

4. **Provide explanations for SQL keywords like `select`, `from`, `where`, etc.**
   * - `select`: Specifies which columns to retrieve.
     - `from`: Specifies the source table.
     - `where`: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

5. **What is the purpose of the `DISTINCT` keyword in SQL?**
   * The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a column, eliminating duplicate values.

6. **List the SQL commands for creating and dropping databases and tables.**
   * - Create Database: `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
     - Drop Database: `DROP DATABASE database_name;`
     - Create Table: `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);`
     - Insert Records: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);`

7. **Explain the use of the `use` command in SQL.**
   * The `use` command is used to select a specific database to work with within an SQL session.

8. **Describe the process of inserting records/rows into an SQL table.**
   * To insert records into an SQL table, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement, specifying the table name and the values to be inserted into the columns.

9. **Provide an SQL query to count all the rows in a table.**
   * To count all the rows in a table, you can use the query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;`

10. **Explain the SQL query: `SELECT * FROM state WHERE population=25;`**
    * This SQL query selects all columns from the "state" table where the "population" column has a value of 25.

11. **Explain the purpose of renaming columns using the `AS` keyword.**
    * The `AS` keyword is used to provide an alias or alternative name for a column in the query's result set.

## Keywords:

1. **Provide explanations for SQL keywords such as `Select`, `from`, `where`, `drop`, `as`, `and`, `between`, etc.**
   * - `Select`: Specifies which columns to retrieve.
     - `from`: Specifies the source table.
     - `where`: Filters rows based on specified conditions.
     - `drop`: Deletes a database or table.
     - `as`: Renames columns or provides aliases.
     - `and`: Combines multiple conditions with logical AND.
     - `between`: Filters rows within a specified range.
     - ... (continue with explanations)

2. **Explain the purpose of the `max` function in SQL.**
   * The `max` function in SQL is used to retrieve the maximum value from a specified column.

3. **Describe how SQL data can be sorted using the `ORDER BY` clause.**
   * The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of an SQL query based on one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

4. **Define logical operators in SQL, including `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.**
   * - `AND`: Combines multiple conditions, and all conditions must be true for the result to be true.
     - `OR`: Combines multiple conditions, and at least one condition must be true for the result to be true.
     - `NOT`: Negates a condition, making it the opposite of its original value.

5. **Provide examples of how logical operators are used in SQL queries.**
   * - `SELECT * FROM state WHERE state_name='up';`: Retrieves rows where the state name is 'up'.
     - `SELECT * FROM state WHERE NOT state_name='up';`: Retrieves rows where the state name is not 'up'.
     - ...

6. **Explain the concept of wildcards in SQL and how `*`, `_`, and `%` are used.**
   * Wildcards in SQL, such as `*`, `_`, and `%`, are used to represent patterns in text data. `*` represents any characters, `_` represents a single character, and `%` represents any number of characters.

7. **Explain how to alter an SQL table using the `ALTER TABLE` command.**
   * The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify an existing table structure, such as adding, modifying, or deleting columns.

8. **Explain the purpose of the `UPDATE` statement in SQL.**
   * The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table, typically by changing the values of specific columns based on specified conditions.
