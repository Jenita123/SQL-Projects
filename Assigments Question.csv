SQL-92, also known as SQL2, was a significant milestone in the standardization of SQL (Structured Query Language). It introduced several key features and improvements over its predecessor SQL-89. Here are some of the key features introduced in SQL-92:

1.	Outer Joins: SQL-92 introduced support for outer joins, allowing you to retrieve rows from one table even if there are no matching rows in another table. This is accomplished using the LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN clauses.
2.	Referential Integrity: SQL-92 enhanced support for referential integrity constraints, including the ability to define and enforce foreign key constraints between tables. This ensures the integrity of relationships between tables in a relational database.
3.	Views: SQL-92 introduced the ability to create views, which are virtual tables defined by SQL queries. Views provide an abstraction layer for users and can simplify complex queries by encapsulating them in a reusable view.
4.	Dynamic SQL: SQL-92 introduced dynamic SQL, allowing you to construct and execute SQL statements dynamically at runtime. This feature is particularly useful for building flexible and customizable database applications.
5.	Common Table Expressions (CTEs): SQL-92 introduced Common Table Expressions, which provide a way to define temporary result sets within a SQL query. CTEs improve query readability and maintainability.
6.	Information Schema: SQL-92 standardized the concept of an information schema, which is a set of read-only system tables and views that provide metadata about the database's structure, such as tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.
7.	User-Defined Data Types (UDTs): SQL-92 introduced support for user-defined data types, allowing database designers to define custom data types that can be used in table definitions.
8.	Catalog and Schema: SQL-92 introduced the concepts of catalog and schema, which help organize database objects. A catalog is a container for schemas, and schemas contain database objects. This feature enhances database organization and management.
9.	Data Types: SQL-92 expanded the list of data types, including support for date and time data types, INTERVAL data types, and BOOLEAN data types.
10.	Enhanced GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses: SQL-92 improved the GROUP BY clause by allowing you to include non-aggregated columns in the SELECT clause, making it easier to write complex queries. The HAVING clause was also enhanced to filter grouped results.

These are some of the key features introduced in SQL-92. This standardization played a crucial role in making SQL a more powerful and standardized language for working with relational databases. Many of these features have become integral parts of modern SQL database systems and have been further extended in subsequent SQL standards.

SQL (Structured Query Language) stood out from other query languages of its time, primarily due to its success in becoming the industry standard for relational database management systems (RDBMS). Here are some key differences between SQL and other query languages of its time:
1.	Standardization: One of the most significant differences is SQL's standardization. SQL was adopted as an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard in 1986 and later as an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard in 1987. This standardization provided a consistent and universal query language for RDBMS, making it easier for developers to write portable code across different database systems.
2.	Declarative Nature: SQL is a declarative language, which means users specify what they want to retrieve or manipulate from the database, rather than specifying how to do it. This declarative approach abstracted the underlying complexity of database operations and made SQL more user-friendly compared to procedural query languages.
3.	Set-Based Operations: SQL introduced set-based operations, allowing users to work with data in sets rather than processing individual records sequentially. This set-based approach is highly efficient and aligns with the principles of the relational model.
4.	Integration with Relational Model: SQL was specifically designed to work with the relational model of data, which was a departure from some earlier query languages that used hierarchical or network models. The relational model's simplicity and elegance appealed to developers and database designers.
5.	Wide Adoption: SQL gained widespread adoption due to its integration with commercial RDBMS products like IBM's DB2, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server. These products used SQL as their query language, contributing to its popularity.
6.	Query Optimization: SQL-based DBMS often had query optimizers that could analyze SQL queries and determine the most efficient way to execute them. This automated optimization made SQL-based systems more efficient and scalable.
7.	Structured Query Language: The name itself, Structured Query Language, emphasized the structured and organized nature of the language, which appealed to developers and businesses looking for a reliable and consistent way to work with data.
8.	Industry Backing: SQL received strong backing from prominent companies like IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft, which further solidified its position as the go-to query language for RDBMS.
9.	Standard Language Features: SQL offered a comprehensive set of features for data retrieval, manipulation, and management. It supported operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE TABLE, along with powerful features for data filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
10.	Portability: SQL's standardization and wide adoption made it possible to write SQL code that could run on various RDBMS without major modifications, reducing vendor lock-in.
While SQL had its advantages, it also faced competition from other query languages, especially in the early days of the relational database era. However, SQL's standardization, broad industry support, and alignment with the relational model ultimately set it apart and contributed to its dominance as the standard query language for RDBMS.
